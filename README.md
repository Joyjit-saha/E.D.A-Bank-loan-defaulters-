# E.D.A-Bank-loan-defaulters-
Exploratory data analysis about bank loan data to identify loan defaulters.
Business Understanding:
The Loan-providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming defaulters. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyze the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
The data given below contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:

The client with payment difficulties: he/she had a late payment of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in our sample
All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time
When a client applies for a loan, four types of decisions could be taken by the client/company):

Approved: The Company has approved the loan application
Canceled: The client canceled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk the client received worse pricing which he did not want.
Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client did not meet their requirements etc.)
Unused offer: Loan has been cancelled by the client but at different stages of the process.
